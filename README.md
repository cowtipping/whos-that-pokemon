## Motivation

This was a project made early into my bootcamp at [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/), using vanilla JavaScript, which we learned in week 1 and using public APIs, which we learned in week 2.

I revisted those topics a few weeks later as a little refresher side-project.

## TypeScript Teachings

This is the first of my old projects I've converted to TS.
- Came across a lot of "is possibly null" errors and added error-checking for those.  
- Had an issue with "property src does not exist on type 'Element'" which was fixed using type assertions (ie. trust me, bro ðŸ˜Ž) by adding `as HTMLImageElement` after the offending sprite definition.  
- The same issue also reared its ugly head as it did not like `e.target.value` so I learned I can use `(e.target as HTMLButtonElement).value` instead.  
- There weren't a huge amount of changes other than those as TS was able to infer most of the types.
