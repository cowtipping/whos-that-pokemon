## Lessons Learned

This was a project made early into my bootcamp at [School Of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.com/), using vanilla JavaScript, which we learned in week 1 and using public APIs, which we learned in week 2.

I revisted those topics a few weeks later as a little refresher side-project.
